# NavAstro-Sextant-App-for-watch
This is a NavAstro Celestial Calculator App for my Android Amazfit Stratos watch.
This app calculate the ephemerids for the sun and moon, and let you enter a sextant high measurement to find youy position with the sight reduction method.
It give you an Intercept & Azimut to draw you lines of position.
